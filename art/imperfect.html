    <p><b>You’re a user, a consumer, a producer, a product, a human. Technology companies understand more about the nature of this than you do as you use their services.</b></p>

    <p>IIf actions define who you are, what does it mean when a subset of your behaviour is captured, scrutinized, and recreated? On your device, dozens of entities each collect dozens of dimensions of what you say about yourself, how you make choices, what you read and watch, where you are, what you’re doing, and how you’re doing it. No one entity holds all the cards in the deck. No one user fully understands their each and every relationship with every entity.</p>
