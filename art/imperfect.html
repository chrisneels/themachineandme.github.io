    <p><b>You’re a user; a consumer; a producer; a product; a human. Technology companies understand the nature of this more than you do.</b></p>

    <p>If actions define who you are, what does it mean when a subset of your behaviour is captured, scrutinized, and recreated?</p>
    <p>Via your device, dozens of different entities collect dozens of dimensions about you: what you say about yourself, how you make choices, what you read and watch, where you are, what you’re doing, and how you’re doing it. Each entity is trying to piece together a complete picture of who you are (for their own purposes). Meanwhile, you (and virtually everyone else) don't have a complete understanding of your relation to each and every entity. There's steep information asymmetry.</p>
